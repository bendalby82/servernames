# Server Names
## Overview
Lists of useful names that can be used for servers, environments, cabinets, clients, rooms and so on.  
* Improve security by using names that carry less information - "ebony" and "onyx" server rather than "test" and "live"
* Build culture by creating a more personalised working environment
## Usage
Lists are classified by size, and automatically built in JSON, CSV and XML format. All files are encoded in UTF8.  

You can rely on names to have the following qualities:
* Lower case
* Single word
* Only using characters [a-z]
